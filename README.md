# ZeeTweak
ZeeTweak is an overhaul of the UI for the [Zeeweii DSO3D12 oscilloscope](http://www.zeeweii.com/productinfo/dso3d12.html), including replacement fonts, most UI elements, and various fixes.

## Notes
- To customize the firmware, place the desired mod files in a directory and use [FLSTweak](https://github.com/taligentx/FLSTweak) to generate a new firmware file. See Flashing below to apply the firmware.
- The mods in this repo cover resources that are directly stored in the firmware (not part of the compiled code). It will take reverse engineering of the code to functionally change the UI, so the replacements here are a starting point for further work.
- Since UI preferences are highly subjective, post an [Issue](https://github.com/taligentx/ZeeTweak/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/taligentx/ZeeTweak/pulls) for what you'd like to see - there is plenty of room for improvement. Discussion and (especially) contributions are welcome!

## Files
- `Zeeweii_DSO3D12` directory:
  - `dso3d12_v3.0.6_III_mod_v3.1.fls` - an example firmware with all mods applied.
  - `images` - viewable files of the original and modified UI images.
  - `mods` - binary files of the original and modified data for use with [FLSTweak](https://github.com/taligentx/FLSTweak).

- `tools` directory:
  - `zrle2bmp.py` - converts Zeeweii's custom RLE compression used on some images to a standard RGB565 bitmap (example: boot logo)

- `disassembly` directory:
  - `dso3d12_3.0.6_ghidra_v0.1.gar` - firmware project for [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).
    - Install the [ghidra_csky_ck804](https://github.com/taligentx/ghidra_csky_ck804) plugin - I've forked the original plugin to add instructions seen in the firmware. Needs help to improve the disassembly and decompiler.
    - Open the firmware project in Ghidra using File > Restore Project.
  - `docs` directory:
    - Note: The DSO3D12 scope uses the [Winner Micro W806](https://doc.winnermicro.net/w800/en/latest/soc_guides/index.html) MCU, containing a [Xuantie XT804 processor](https://www.xrvm.cn/community/download) (ck804ef with FPUv2 + DSPv2) based on the C-SKY v2 architecture.
    - Translations are Google and DeepL, both can be useful for the same document.
    - `Winner Micro W80x Register Manual 2.1 (2020)` - MCU documentation including memory ranges to see things in Ghidra like UARTs, GPIO, etc. (original Chinese + machine translated English)
    - `C-SKY ISA User Guide 1.15.12 (2014)` - covers general + floating point instructions
    - `Xuantie E804 User Manual 2.0 (2024)` - updated ISA + DSP instructions (original Chinese + machine translated English)
    - `T-HEAD 800 Series ABI Standards Manual 2.2 (2021)` - processor information and pseudo-instructions
    - `Xuantie CPU Software Development Guide V3.4 (2024)` - updated processor information (original Chinese + machine translated English)

## Mods
The `mods` directory contains:
- `font_large, font_small` - fonts covering ASCII characters 32-126 as 1-bit data.
  - [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) can convert the raw data to a series of images:
      - `$ magick -depth 1 -size 8x13 gray:font_small_ref.bin font_small_ref.png`
      - `$ magick -depth 1 -size 16x16 gray:font_large_ref.bin font_large_ref.png`
  - Thanks to [@timschuerewegen](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/new-2ch-pocket-dsosg-sigpeak-dso2512g/msg5124096/#msg5124096) for developing the fonts (originally for the DSO2512G) and permitting their addition to this repo! Check out the Discord channel for a detailed discussion of Zeeweii firmware and reverse engineering work for the DSO2512G.

- `image_XXXXXX` - images are either monochrome 1-bit per pixel or color 16-bits per pixel (RGB565 format); filenames are the offset of the data in the firmware file.
  - 1bpp images:
    - Viewable as PNG files in the `images` directory
    - Convert raw data to image (must specify the size): `$ magick -depth 1 -size 67x198 gray:image_368172_ref.bin image_368172_ref.png`
    - Convert image to raw data: `$ magick image.png -depth 1 gray:image.bin`
  - 16bpp images:
    - Viewable as BMP files in `images`
  - Thanks to [@Dmitur](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/another-dsodmm-zeeweii-dso3d12-claimed-120mhz250msps/msg5789049/#msg5789049) on the EEVBlog forums for locating and documenting these resources, and for permitting their addition to this repo! See the post for additional info.
- `label_calib` - fixes typos for DMM calibration text
- `label_measurements` - alters the measurements labels and matches the labels in `image_364864_mod.bin`
- `label_normal` - fixes typo for the "Normal" trigger message

## Flashing
Linux/macOS:
  1. Download and extract the [WM IoT SDK](https://doc.winnermicro.net/download/version/).
  2. Install required packages - from the `wm_iot_sdk` directory:
     ```
     python -m pip install --user -r tools/wm/requirements.txt
     ```
  3. With the DSO3D12 turned off, press and hold the power button - the scope will enter a boot loop and enable the scope's serial port to allow for flashing. Keep the power button pressed until flashing is complete.
  4. Check the name of the serial port - on macOS, use the `tty.wchusbserial` device:
     ```
     % ls /dev/tty*
     /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port
     /dev/tty.usbserial-1410  
     /dev/tty.wchusbserial1410
     ```
  5. From the `wm_iot_sdk/tools/wm/` directory, run `flash.py` with the serial port and firmware:
     ```
     % python3 flash.py --port /dev/tty.wchusbserial1410 --image dso3d12_v3.0.6_III_mod.fls 
     connecting serial...
     serial connected
     trying reset device...
     wait serial sync...
     serial sync success
     trying baudrate 2000000...
     start download image...
     download dso3d12_v3.0.6_III_mod.fls...
     0% [##############################] 100%
     flash device complete
     ```
  6. Done! Release the power button.

Windows:
  1. Download [Upgrade Tools](http://www.isme.fun/?log=blog&id=34).
  2. Change the language to English from the top left menu (third option).
  3. Set "Chip" to `W80X` and set the image to the firmware .fls file.
  4. Press and hold the scope power button to enable the serial port until flashing is complete.
  5. Select the new COM port, click "Open Serial", and then "Download" to flash.
  6. Done! Release the power button.

## Home
The home screen (accessed by pressing the power button once) is a 320x240 16bpp image in `image_153880`, which opens up the possibilities for modification. I've included a few different options as an example of customizing this UI.
